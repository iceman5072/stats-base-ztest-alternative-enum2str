## Introduction

In statistics, the Z-test is a popular method for hypothesis testing. It helps determine if there is a significant difference between sample and population means. The alternative hypothesis is crucial in this process. Our utility simplifies the conversion of enumeration constants into human-readable strings. This makes it easier for developers and statisticians to understand and communicate their results.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: A straightforward API to convert enumeration constants to strings.
- **Supports Multiple Alternatives**: Covers various Z-test alternatives.
- **Node.js Compatible**: Works seamlessly in Node.js environments.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and a small footprint.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. You can do this via npm. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install stats-base-ztest-alternative-enum2str
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can import it into your project and start using it right away. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the utility:

```javascript
const zTestAlternative = require('stats-base-ztest-alternative-enum2str');

// Convert enumeration constant to string
const alternativeString = zTestAlternative(1); // Example constant
console.log(alternativeString); // Outputs the corresponding string
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the utility with different enumeration constants:

### Example 1: One-Tailed Test

```javascript
const zTestAlternative = require('stats-base-ztest-alternative-enum2str');

const oneTailed = zTestAlternative(1); // Assuming 1 represents one-tailed
console.log(oneTailed); // Outputs: "One-Tailed Test"
```

### Example 2: Two-Tailed Test

```javascript
const zTestAlternative = require('stats-base-ztest-alternative-enum2str');

const twoTailed = zTestAlternative(2); // Assuming 2 represents two-tailed
console.log(twoTailed); // Outputs: "Two-Tailed Test"
```
